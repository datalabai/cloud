gcloud docker push gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/hello-node:v1

Create clusters
$ gcloud container clusters create hello-world --num-nodes 1 --machine-type n1-standard-1
$ gcloud compute instances list

Create Pod
$ kubectl run hello-node --image=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/hello-node:v1 --port=8080
* A pod is a group of containers, tied together for the purposes of administration and networking. A pod can contain a single container or many. This example needs just one container to run your Node.js image. It will serve content on port 8080.

Allow External traffic
$ kubectl expose rc hello-node --type="LoadBalancer"
$ kubectl get services hello-node
* By default, the pod is only accessible by its internal IP within the cluster. In order to make the hello-node container accessible from outside the virtual network, you have to expose the pod as a service.

Scaleout
$ kubectl scale rc hello-node --replicas=3

Cleanup
$ kubectl delete services hello-node
$ kubectl delete rc hello-node
$ gcloud container clusters delete hello-world
